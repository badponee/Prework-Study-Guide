# <Coding Bootcamp Pre-work Study Guide>

## Description 

Notes on the Coding Bootcamp Pre-work modules, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This document was created as a way to help absorb and organize the large amount of new information we are learning. By creating this page, I was able to practice coding at a basic level and create a repository I can return to for reference. This hands-on activity allowed me to learn about pushing and pulling code to github, as well as creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and deploying them.
